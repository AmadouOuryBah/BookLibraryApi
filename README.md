# BookLibraryApi
In this mini project I have created a Book library Api using Sqlserver , entity framework, Csharp and Asp.net 
I have used the code first approach to implement the project
The application has three layers the business logic layer( where we have the services of our app)
the data access layer (where we have our entities the repsotories folder in which I have handled all the request to the database
then I injected each entity repository into his specific service)
And the and we have the presentation layer (Where we return our data to the client using Controller and some basics http status)
In the Project I have used three Entities: Book , Genre And EditionHouse .
Relationship which I have applied in the mini Project are : One to many and Many to Many
